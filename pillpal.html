<p class="project-main-p slab-body">
  PillPal is an app that is designed to partner with the PillPal smart canister. It will help users manage and track their prescriptions.
  <br><br>
  My first step is to find a target audience. In this case, the topic and preliminary research was done by someone else, and then I picked it up at the design phase. I was looking at designing for a very broad audience, with a large demographic of older users. This means the app needs to be simple and easy to use.
  <br><br>
  I designed PillPal to only have two main screens and functions. The list of medications is one page, and the second is a more detailed information page of each medication. The reminders, dosage and duration are all set by the doctor.
  <br><br>

    These three personas represented the main demographics of my target audience. A large percentage of users will be older, and may not be overly fmailiar with smartphones or smart technology.

<figcaption class="project-caption">
  Here is an example of the the flow of PillPal. This is a much earlier design, so it shows many features that were cut out. The alarm system, and the page for entering a new medication were removed for simplicity.

<figcaption class="project-caption">
  The final app flow consists of only two main screens. I removed everything that wasn't absolutely neccesary, because the app needed to be simple and easy to use. The first page is a list of medications, which takes you to a page with more detailed information about each one. Here there is an option to refill your prescription or see more information about it.
